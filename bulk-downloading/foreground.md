You must comply to your tile server's ToS. Failure to do so may result in you being banned from their services.

OpenStreetMap's can be [found here](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles): specifically bulk downloading is discouraged, and forbidden after zoom level 13. Other servers may have different terms.

This package is not responsible for your misuse of another tile server.
