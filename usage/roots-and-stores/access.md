# Access (advanced)

```dart
FlutterMapTileCaching.rootDirectory.access;
FlutterMapTileCaching.instance('storeName').access;
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
This package relies on a carefully constructed structure that can be easily damaged to the point where it may not be able to be repaired without being completely recreated.

Avoid using `access`. If you choose to use it within your application, I may be unable to offer support.
